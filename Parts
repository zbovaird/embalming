Water Flow Sensor
    Digiten Water Flow Sensor
    Model: FL-S420B

Solenoid
    Tailonz Pneumatic Solenoid
    Model: 2W-040-10
    Volts: DC 12V
    Pipe size: 3/8''

MagDrive Pump
    Needs to be a Centrifugal MagDrive to handle non-viscous fluids in a dynamic environment (RoF and Pressure changes)
    *Need to check if machine requries 120V or 240V

Bluetooth Equipment
    Flow Sensor
        Bluetooth module: HC-05 or HC-06; needs to support serial communication (UART)
        Voltage regulator (if necessary): may need voltage regulator to step down the voltage from the water flow
            sensor's output (likely 5V) to the required voltage for the bluetooth module

    Flow Control
        Variable Frequency Drive (VFD)
            Needs to match power rating of the Magdrive Pump
            Needs to be compatible with Magdrive (e.g. three-phase AC motor)
            Bluetooth module needs to be connected to VFD with RS-485
                Laird BT900 Series (approx $25)


    Magdrive
        Arduino Nano 33 BLE
        Motor Driver (allows for variable speed control)
